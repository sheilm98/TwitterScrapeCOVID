@official_lesdog @DeanRosario @guseyk 2008/09 season was when it went back to being known as the Sheffield Shield, sponsored by Weet-bix of all companies üòÇ It was the Pura Cup for many years prior. VIC were deserved winners as they hadn‚Äôt lost a single match but I still wonder how QLD made it with their poor record.
@farver_m Here's a tall request. Since Clint Eastwood turns 90 today, do you have the theme from "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly," by Hugo Montenegro? üòÅ

Trivia: Hugo also composed the theme to "I Dream of Jeannie."

cop think driving into the crowds will get them to leave? like what the fuck
I like that ‚Äúmorning baby‚Äù kinda relationship. The no games, great communication, lots of sex, lots of kissing, lots of cuddling, lots of flirting, lots of being goofy kind of relationship. That makes you want to run 100 miles, read books, clean up your bad habits kind of love.
What happened to the Coronavirus?
can ppl not text me abt work during the weekend :‚Äô)
just think it‚Äôs important people know how peaceful and organized the protest in LA today was. for HOURS. EVERYONE (that i encountered) was kind. mindful. considerate. handing out free food and water. making sure those around them were okay.
In 2020, we‚Äôve had:

- WW3 scares
- Kobe &amp; Gigi‚Äôs death
- Australia burning
- A worldwide pandemic
- All sporting events cancelled
- Confirmed UFO sightings
- Murder Hornets
- Parallel Universe
- Riots across the Country
- And now Anonymous has returned 

It‚Äôs only May. https://t.co/7YClronKk5
Srinakarin Road from the Jas Mall to Samrong is a mess. Skytrain construction and laying a new drainage system = 2 miles of mud, water and barriers with absolutely no way for pedestrians to navigate it. I could cry sometimes at the way pedestrians are treated in this country.
@GaonConnection @Mithileshdhar @Abhishek1992100 @minmsme @upmsme Hope everything will be fine soon. Let's pray together and hope for the best. Help the needy people as much as possible.

a riot is the language of the unheard .
@interpolstan Protests only seem real when countered so the whole democratic mindset is reinforced, people now talk about the economic damage as if that is real and buy into that illusion,  executive orders can now have an excuse to do whatever they want and it goes on and on, soz for the spam

Don‚Äôt act like everyone loved my father. He was assassinated. A 1967 poll reflected that he was one of the most hated men in America. Most hated. Many who quote him now and evoke him to deter justice today would likely hate, and may already hate, the authentic King. #MLK. https://t.co/NF5yHxgi0R

If you've been out in in a big crowd protesting today, consider self quarantining for 14 days to avoid this being a super spreader event. Your actions after the protest can help save Black lives too.

There is a difference between protesters and rioters/looters. One has a voice to be heard, a story to be told and a forced to be reckoned with, the other needs to take some notes #BlackLivesMatter
No group, protestors or civilians, have been anywhere close to as violent and sadistic as the police have been tonight.

What did I miss? Post the most important happenings from tonight in the thread.
i‚Äôve signed 90+ petitions over the past 4 days. it took me 2 minutes at most to sign 10 in one sitting. there are no excuses for not signing these petitions. it‚Äôs not hard.
idk guys‚Ä¶ now that i‚Äôm actually looking at some of the videos‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs a LOT of white people in them‚Ä¶ like a lot more than usual‚Ä¶. a lot more. like enough to make me uncomfortable.
How many people have died or had their homes destroyed because Donald Trump is an embarrassing, weak moron, who lacks the guts and brains to maintain law and order?
@selsoft Let me guess just the black people are looters??? üëÄ 
Well let me ask you are the cops murderers?
The people rioting across America are Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden supporters.  Remember that when you vote in November.

The white people moved to the front and protected us + the cops became less violent like wow wtf

White people: whatever outrage and sadness you are feeling - pouring it all out on social to your Black friends won't make them feel connected to you, it just places the burden of your feelings on top of their own.

Send money, send a meal, buy from Black businesses. BE USEFUL.
