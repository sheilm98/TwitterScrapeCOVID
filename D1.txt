Trump loves seeing people of color out in the streets rioting. That‚Äôs gold to him. He sits back and smiles and is so pleased with himself. Riles up his base. He wants a race war. And a civil war in general.
This election will be be a referendum on a President who so badly bungled the response to a pandemic that 200,000 Americans died needlessly.

He knows this, so he will relentlessly try to shift the debate.

But he will fail. It will be about the 200,000.

Alright. Real talk.

Was it right to kill Floyd? No. It was not. He was unlawfully killed.

Does that make it okay to vandalize a police station, rob a Target, and burn the entire building to the ground? Absolutely NOT. That is NOT okay.
The very fact that wearing a mask is an act to protect the "other" from you and thus an act of social solidarity explains why in U.S. society, the most individualistic and alienated on the planet, you see the scenes of people not wearing masks. Self-indulgent narcisism = USA
@RaeHendrix_ @swirvinatl @TemiOgunrinde Don‚Äôt forget the protesters who showed up banging on state capital workers doors armed to the teeth over FUCKING MASKS.
Trump will exploit the killing and riots Minneapolis.  We are in the final weeks of the Trump nightmare. Justice is coming. Just not today.  We can obtain federal judicial control over the police in Minneapolis. Just not today. We can charge the officer with a federal hate crime.

@DoyelNathan @Zigmanfreud Kinda hard to laugh about it when the economy has pretty much been obliterated.
@toniprzy @TwitterSafety You mean the 100,000+ people who have died from the global viral pandemic that Trump has ignored and lied about?   He continues on with his bullshit every day.
The fact the officer had 18 complaints &amp; was still working plus in a position of power genuinely blows my mind. 

What job do you know that would still employ you after 18 write ups?! 

Can the government please stop employing racist sociopaths &amp; pretending like they didn‚Äôt know.
